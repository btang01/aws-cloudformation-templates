Description: A stack for deploying containerized applications onto a cluster of EC2
             hosts using Elastic Container Service. This stack runs containers on
             hosts that are in a private VPC subnet. Outbound network traffic from the
             hosts must go out through a NAT gateway. There are two load balancers, one
             inside the public subnet, which can be used to send traffic to the
             containers in the private subnet, and one in the private subnet, which can
             be used for private internal traffic between internal services.

Parameters:
  DesiredCapacity:
    Type: Number
    Default: '3'
    Description: Number of EC2 instances to launch into ECS cluster.
  
  MaxSize:
    Type: Number
    Default: '6'
    Description: Max number of EC2 instances that can be launched into ECS cluster.

Mappings:
  # Hard values for the subnet masks. These masks define
  # the range of internal IP addresses that can be assigned.
  # The VPC can have all IP's from 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.255.255
  # There are four subnets which cover the ranges:
  #
  # 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.0.255
  # 10.0.1.0 - 10.0.1.255
  # 10.0.2.0 - 10.0.2.255
  # 10.0.3.0 - 10.0.3.255
  #
  # If you need more IP addresses (perhaps you have so many
  # instances that you run out) then you can customize these
  # ranges to add more
